
In C programming, a conditional statement is a type of control statement that allows the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. The most commonly used conditional statement is the "if" statement.

Syntax : 
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}

The "if" statement evaluates the condition inside the parentheses. If the condition is true (non-zero), the code inside the curly braces following the "if" statement is executed. If the condition is false (zero), the code inside the curly braces is skipped.

Optionally, you can include an "else" statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false:

Syntax :
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}


In this case, if the condition inside the "if" statement is false, the code inside the curly braces following the "else" statement is executed.

Additionally, you can use the "else if" statement to specify multiple conditions:

syntax :

if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}

This allows you to create a chain of conditions, where each condition is evaluated sequentially until one of them is found to be true.

Nested "if" Statements:
if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true

    if (condition2) {
        // Code to be executed if condition1 and condition2 are true
    }
}


In nested "if" statements, an "if" statement is placed inside another "if" statement's block. The inner "if" statement is only executed if the outer "if" statement's condition is true.

"if...else" Statements:

if (condition1) {
    if (condition1) {
        // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
    } else {
        // Code to be executed if condition1 is false
    }
} else {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is false
}

In "if...else" statements, if the condition inside the "if" statement is true, the code inside the corresponding block is executed. Otherwise, if the condition is false, the code inside the "else" block is executed.
