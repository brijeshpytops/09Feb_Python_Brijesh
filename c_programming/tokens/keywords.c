/*
In C programming, keywords (also known as reserved words) are predefined identifiers that have special meanings and purposes within the C language. These keywords are reserved by the language and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.) by the programmer.

Keywords in C are used to define the syntax and structure of the language. They are an integral part of the language's grammar and are used to specify various actions, control structures, data types, and other language features. Using keywords according to their predefined meanings is essential for writing correct and understandable C code.

Here are some examples of keywords in C:

auto
break
case
char
const
continue
default
do
double
else
enum
extern
float
for
goto
if
int
long
register
return
short
signed
sizeof
static
struct
switch
typedef
union
unsigned
void
volatile
while

These keywords have specific meanings and are used for various purposes such as defining data types (int, char, float, etc.), control flow structures (if, else, while, for, etc.), and other language features.
