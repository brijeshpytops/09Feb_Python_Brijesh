/*
In C programming, a variable is a named storage location in computer memory that holds a value of a particular data type.Variables are used to store and manipulate data within a program. Each variable has a specific data type that determines the type of data it can store (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, characters, etc.), as well as the range of values it can hold and the operations that can be performed on it.

Variables in C must be declared before they are used. The declaration specifies the variable's name and data type, allowing the compiler to allocate memory for the variable. Variable declarations in C typically follow this syntax:

data_type variable_name = value;
data_type variable_name;

For example:
int age;
float price;
char ch;
flaot height;
char grade;

age = 25;
height = 5.9;
grade = 'A';

Variables in C can also be initialized at the time of declaration:

int age = 25;
float height = 5.9;
char grade = 'A';
